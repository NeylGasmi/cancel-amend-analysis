# Trade Modification Analysis

This script was written to better understand how trade modification events
(amendments and cancellations) appear in BMLL trades data.

The goal is to quantify their frequency, timing, and consistency across venues,
and to identify potential data quality issues related to duplicate or late
modification events.
